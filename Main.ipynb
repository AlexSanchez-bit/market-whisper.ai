thinking about the company before earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents for the fourth quarter has remained unchanged for the last seven days  This represents a year over year earnings plunge of 34 8  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  643 million for the impending quarter  up 153 7  from the year ago quarter Range Resources Corporation Price and EPS

Range Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Although a favorable Zacks rank increases the predictive power of ESP  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Please note that the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement   Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which  per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  Houston  TX based EOG Resources   NYSE EOG   is an upstream company  It has an Earnings ESP of  3 61  and a Zacks Rank of 1  You can see  WildHorse Resource Development Corporation   NYSE WRD    based in Houston  TX  is also an upstream energy firm  It has an Earnings ESP of   5 26  and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1  Dallas  TX

Fianna Fail  laid out their economic policies in election manifestos on Friday ahead of a Feb  8 poll \\nWhile neighboring Britain s Labour and Conservative parties presented starkly opposing economic visions before an election there in December  Ireland s two broadly center right rivals share similar policies on the economy and Brexit \\nPolls suggest Fianna Fail may lead another minority government propped up by Fine Gael from the opposition benches  as Fianna Fail has done since 2016 \\nHere are some of the parties key fiscal policies \\nSPENDING VERSUS TAX\\nBoth parties have committed to staying within the 11 billion euros that Ireland s finance ministry forecasts will be available for tax cuts or additional current spending for 2021 2025  Fianna Fail says it will hold back 1 2 billion euros to account for demographic pressures and public pay increases beyond what the finance ministry has allowed for \\nFianna Fail would favor a 4 1 ratio of new spending to tax cuts  while Fine Gael has committed to a 3 1 ratio in favor of spending \\nTAX CHANGES\\nBoth are in favor of cutting income tax rates  but Fine Gael more so  Its policy centered around increasing the threshold at which workers pay the highest rate of income tax to 50 000 euros from 35 300 euros will leave an average earner just under 3 000 euros better off by 2025  the party says \\nFianna Fail s plans to increase the standard rate income tax band by 3 000 euros for a single person and 6 000 euros for a couple will put almost 1 400 euros back in the pocket of someone earning just under the average full time wage \\nFianna Fail says it will reduce the capital gains tax rate to 25  from 33   Fine Gael will review the rate at each budget over the next five years \\nCORPORATION TAX\\nFine Gael and Fianna Fail are committed to retaining the low 12 5  corporation tax rate  long a magnet for multinational firms like Apple  O AAPL   Google  O GOOGL  and Facebook  O FB   among the country s largest employers  They also back the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  as the forum for global tax reforms  rather than any action at an EU level \\nPENSIONS\\nAfter emerging as an unexpected election issue  Fianna Fail has said that pending a review  it will defer a planned increase in the pension age to 67 in 2021 at a cost 217 million euros  Fine Gael recommitted to moving the qualifying age to 67 from 66 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028 \\nBoth parties plan to increase the state pension by 25 euros a week over the next five years \\nHOUSING INCENTIVES\\nIn a bid to help prospective buyers now paying record high rents   another big election issue   Fine Gael said it would boost its tax rebate for first time buyers to 30 000 euros from 20 000 euros  Fianna Fail would increase the limit to 25 000 euros while also introducing a savings scheme where the state would provide up to 10 000 euros more if a buyer saved three times that amount \\nRAINY DAY FUND\\nBoth parties have committed to making an annual deposit to the state s new contingency reserve set up to shield the treasury from potential future shocks  Fine Gael would add 500 million euros a year  Fianna Fail 750 million euros \\nBREXIT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two parties say they will work to secure the closest possible trading relationship with Britain that would also retain a level playing field on regulations after Brexit  Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang raises Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  target from  150 to  250  praising the strong AirPods performance \\nZhang is concerned about iPhone ASPs from the iPhone 11 family skewing towards the cheaper model  and the potential impact of the low cost iPhone SE successor  which earlier reports suggested could launch in March \\nThe analyst is also cautious about the 5G optimism   We believe the market has become too enthusiastic about the upcoming 5G cycle  We expect the cycle to be similar to a regular smartphone upgrade cycle  or even slower than a regular upgrade cycle  due to consumers waiting for 5G networks to get better and 5G phone prices to drop   Apple  AAPL  1 2   TV  had 33 6M U S  subscribers in Q4  according to new Ampere Analysis data via the WSJ \\nThe figure put Apple in third place among the top streaming video services  behind Netflix  61 3M  and Amazon Prime Video  42 2M   and two slots ahead of Disney   23 2M  \\nApple TV  launched in Q4 with only 11 series or movies available for streaming  The company offset the soft launch with a  4 99 month price and offered free subscriptions to customers purchasing a new Apple device \\nThe Apple data was included in WSJ s article about how Amazon Prime Video accepts  nonprofessional and questionable content  to bolster its video content

S P 500 index rose nearly 29  and that the Nasdaq rose by 35  in 2019  It s what the market can do in 2020 that matters  What was impressive above any of the major stocks is that Apple Inc   NASDAQ  AAPL  posted a gain of 85  in 2019  Its run has continued in 2020 with a gain of 8 7   It most recently closed at  319 23 a share  and many on Wall Street have rapidly increased their expectations for 2020  based on a coming iPhone supercycle and with Apple s services on their way to becoming the next  100 billion category Wedbush Securities has been among the most bullish firms when it comes to Apple posting ever higher returns  When the firm s Daniel Ives first posted a  350 price target on Apple  many analysts were still  75 or even  100 lower with their price targets  Now Ives is at it again  formally raising his price target to  400  currently a street high target price It may seem amazing that Apple can keep running  with gains almost every day over the past couple of months  Its market cap is already  1 4 trillion  and a  400 target price implies another gain of just over 25   before adding in its 1  dividend for total return investors  That also would imply close to a  1 75 trillion market cap for Apple if this  400 target price is achieved   and this call is a week before Apple reports earnings  Ives believes that Apple will handily beat consensus expectations  with a strong holiday season and solid iPhone 11 demand purchases div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  While Ives had already laid out that Apple s fundamentals could support a  400 target price  actually raising it is more impressive now that it is a formal price target  Ives said   overwhelming positive data points we are picking up from the supply chain   which Wall Street has underestimated for the magnitude of this 5G upgrade cycle  Ives also said Our recent Asia checks around iPhone 11 units look robust and coupled with  jaw dropping  AirPods momentum should lead to clear upside in the upcoming results with strong March guidance also likely on the horizon  While the stock has had a massive rally over the past year and thus far in 2020  we continue to believe this is a  must own  stock into what we would characterize as a transformational 5G super cycle over the next 12 to 18 months with Apple being our favorite 5G play  Our time spent in Asia last week gave us further conviction that this 5G super cycle is real and will be a major growth catalyst for iPhone sales both domestically as well as in China The iPhone install base is currently put at about 925 million iPhones worldwide  but roughly 350 million of those are said to be  in the window of an upgrade opportunity   That upgrade cycle will include new smartphone versions and models for the iPhone 12  with at least five different iPhone versions set to launch this year  Ives also sees the coming 5G launch in September also having a number of versions  although the specs might not be known until April Wedbush did acknowledge that Apple s monumental run might seem like all the good news has been priced into the shares  Ives s answer to that is a  resounding NO   The first part of the massive iPhone upgrade opportunity is expected to be the 5G supercycle  with 215 million to 220 million units expected for fiscal 2021 demand  Ives further noted strength from services  China and other issues Coupling this dynamic with a metamorphosis like valuation re rating by the Street around the company s  50 billion  annual services revenue stream is the 1 2 punch to how we ultimately see a stock in the  400 range by year end  Looking out further  we believe by the end of 2021 Apple has potential to be the first  2 trillion valuation given the 5G tailwinds and services momentum potential over the coming years  Importantly on the China front  with our estimates that roughly 60 million to 70 million iPhones are in the window of an upgrade opportunity in this key region Cook   Co  are now on pace to convert at least half of these customers over the next few quarters  The services business we assign a  500 billion to  650 billion valuation range given the increasingly importance of this key revenue stream that is getting a new appreciation by investors as Cupertino further monetizes its golden jewel installed base Apple stock was indicated up with a 0 3  gain to  320 10 early Friday morning  and that would be above this week s all time high of  319 99  \\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tALSO READ  5 Top Income Stocks That Could Soar in 2020 as Interest Rates

election  many Democratic White House contenders have argued in favor of either breaking up or tightening regulation of companies such as  Facebook Inc   O FB   Alphabet Inc s Google  O GOOGL  and Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  \\nRepublican President Donald Trump s administration has also stepped up its scrutiny of Big Tech  conducting a wide ranging probe into whether major digital tech companies engaged in anticompetitive practices \\nSocial media platforms are under particular scrutiny over their efforts to curb dissemination of misinformation and false claims  years after U S  intelligence agencies said Russia used them to wage an influence operation aimed at interfering with the 2016 election  Moscow has denied the claim \\nHere are the leading presidential candidates  positions on Big Tech \\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\\nTrump  whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016  has stopped short of calling for tech giants to be broken up  but said  obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly   when asked about major tech companies in the past \\nTrump s Department of Justice announced in July it was conducting an antitrust review of  market leading online platforms  \\nBig tech companies such as Facebook  Google  Apple Inc  O AAPL  and Amazon also face a slew of U S  antitrust probes by the federal government  state attorneys general and Congress \\nFORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN\\nBiden slammed big tech companies in a January interview with the New York Times  saying he had  never been a fan of Facebook  and arguing that online platforms should not be allowed immunity for content posted by users \\nHe also clashed with Facebook and Google over their political ad policies after they refused to take down a Trump ad that the Biden team said contained false claims about his son Hunter s dealings with Ukraine \\nBiden  who was vice president in the Silicon Valley friendly Obama administration  has said that splitting up companies such as Facebook was  something we should take a really hard look at  but that it was  premature  to make a final judgment \\nU S  SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN\\nWarren is leading the charge to break up big tech companies on the grounds they hold outsized influence and stifle competition \\nShe has called for legislation to restrict large tech platforms   which she would designate as  platform utilities   from owning and participating in a marketplace at the same time  Under this law  Apple would not be allowed to both run the App Store and sell its own apps on it  for example \\nThe senator from Massachusetts also said she would nominate regulators to unwind anticompetitive mergers such as Facebook s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram  and Amazon s deal for the Whole Foods supermarket chain \\nWarren has criticized Facebook s policy of exempting politicians  ads from fact checking  running deliberately false ads that claimed Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump s re election bid \\nU S  SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS\\nSanders  who frequently criticizes corporate influence  has also called for the breakup of big tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon \\nThe Vermont lawmaker has also said that he will have the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  review all mergers that have taken place during the Trump administration  His broad plan to reshape corporate America would also mandate all large companies be owned partly by their workers \\nSanders has been particularly vocal in his attacks on Amazon over its tax contributions and working conditions at its warehouses \\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\\nIn general  Pete Buttigieg  who became Facebook s 287th user shortly after it was launched in 2004 at Harvard University  where he was a student  has been more reluctant to slam the tech giants than some other candidates \\nThough he has said that the breakup of big tech companies  should be on the table   the former South Bend  Indiana  mayor does not think it is a politician s place to designate which companies should be broken up \\nU S  SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR\\nKlobuchar has made oversight of big technology companies one of her major issues in Congress and argued for data privacy laws and net neutrality safeguards as priorities at her campaign launch in February \\nShe has not endorsed Warren s plan for their breakup  saying that she would first want investigations  Her plan for her first 100 days in office includes an  aggressive retrospective review of mergers   which she said she would pay for with an extra merger fee on  megamergers  \\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG\\nFormer New York City Mayor Bloomberg told the Bay Area News Group in January that breaking up big tech companies  just to be nasty is not an answer  and that he does not think Senators Warren and Sanders  know what they re talking about  on the issue  He said he was open to more limited antitrust enforcement \\nThe billionaire media mogul  who has launched a television and digital ad blitz  says online platforms should be legally treated the same as news publications  As the founder of Bloomberg News  he made his fortune selling financial information to Wall Street firms \\nANDREW YANG\\nAlthough Yang has said  we would be well served  if big tech companies were to break themselves up  he has argued that competition is not the answer to key problems with big tech \\nYang  the former chief executive of a start up  has focused on the negative effects of tech on mental health and said he would create a Department of Attention Economy to look at how to responsibly design and use apps and devices \\nYang  who has benefited from a surge of grassroots social media supporters  told the New York Times in January that he did not  have confidence that any of my opponents get the internet  \\nTOM STEYER\\nCalifornia billionaire Steyer says that monopolies either have to be dismantled or regulated  but that to win against Trump  Democrats will have to  show the American people that we don t just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies  \\nSteyer s campaign has been noted for its massive ad spending  which helped push him to the debate stage  including more than  17 million in Facebook ads  according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive  A week that started with a coronavirus panic looks set to end on a high note  Earnings optimism and the fact that investors no longer seem to be panicking over the deadly China illness is helping  Wall Street has also been distracted by red hot Tesla \\r\\n\\r\\n

Wall Street is underestimating a renaissance for the iPhone maker  and the  magnitude of the 5G upgrade cycle    Ives is upbeat after a visit to Asia  where he says iPhone suppliers appear to be doing well  implying customers want to buy  He added that AirPods demand is  jaw dropping   and he expects upbeat results next week and strong March guidance    While the stock has had a massive rally over the past year and thus far in 2020  we continue to believe this is a  must own  stock into what we would characterize as a transformational 5G supercycle over the next 12 to 18 months with Apple being our favorite 5G play   said the analyst who has been pounding the table over Apple s fortunes lately   Apple shares are up around 9  so far this year  31  over three months and 53  in the past six months  Note that Ives helped fuel the rally for the electric car maker s shares this week by bumping up his price target 50    Bottom line  he says  all the good news isn t baked into the share price yet   Note Apple results are due Jan  28 and Tesla Jan  29  As for Apple this morning  Ives s call isn t boosting them in a big way so far    Read  Broadcom says deals with Apple could be worth  15

raises his Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  target from  350 to  400  saying the Street is underestimating the  magnitude of the 5G upgrade cycle  \\nIves cites checks with Apple iPhone suppliers that implied that customers want to buy \\nThe analyst calls the AirPods demand  jaw dropping  and expects upbeat earnings and guidance next week \\nApple will report earnings on January 28 \\nApple shares are up 0 3  pre market to  320 25  The company has a Bullish average Sell side rating  Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades \\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us \\nBelow  we take a look at Apple  AAPL   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions \\nIt s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period \\nYou can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    \\nSet to Beat the Market \\nIn order to see if AAPL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of iPhones  iPads and other products holds up \\nLooking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area \\nFor AAPL  shares are up 2 71  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Mini computers industry is up 3 55  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 11  compares favorably with the industry s 9 47  performance as well \\nWhile any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Apple have increased 28 33  over the past quarter  and have gained 109 06  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 11 18  and 28 24   respectively \\nInvestors should also pay attention to AAPL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AAPL is currently averaging 28 968 880 shares for the last 20 days \\nEarnings Outlook\\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AAPL \\nOver the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AAPL s consensus estimate  increasing from  13 06 to  13 16 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period \\nBottom Line\\nTaking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that AAPL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Apple on your short list  What a difference a year makes   After flubbing the holiday period a year ago  Apple

sales  The company s stock has more than doubled over the past 12 months amid optimism about new services like streaming video and the potential for a wave of iPhone upgrades later this year  when 5G

performing given Apple s limited disclosures around its various business areas as well as its free trials for those who buy a new device  Investors will nonetheless be looking for any indications from management that consumers are paying up for the service and sticking around   Much as investors will want to know how Apple s new iPhone 11 line and popular AirPods headphones did during the holiday season  the stock s big rally is predicated on the future  Chief Executive Tim Cook is never one to spill big future plans  but investors will be looking for any new nuggets of information Tuesday afternoon to gauge whether the stock s recent run up is justified  The company is reportedly planning to launch a lower cost iPhone in the spring before launching 5G devices later in the year  and some say Apple may consider a more permanent shift to the way it launches new phones by staggering introductions instead of releasing all models in the fall  Analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for  88 45 billion in December quarter revenue  which would be Apple s highest quarterly total on record  surpassing its  88 29 billion haul from December 2017  The company was expected to crack the  90 billion mark a year ago before its disclosures about emerging market weakness sent the stock cratering   What to expect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Earnings  Apple is expected to report record earnings of  4 54 a share  according to FactSet  up from  4 18 in the year ago quarter  According to Estimize  which crowdsources projections from hedge funds  academics and others  the average estimate calls for  4 59 in earnings per share  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Revenue  The FactSet consensus models  88 45 billion in revenue  while the Estimize consensus calls for  88 42 billion  Apple generated  84 31 billion in the year earlier period   The iPhone is expected to drive  51 38 billion in revenue  according to FactSet  which would represent the bulk of Apple s total but growth of only 1  from a year ago  Analysts surveyed by FactSet project similarly small year over year changes for the iPad and Mac categories  expected to generate  6 73 billion and  7 18 billion in revenue  respectively  The wearables and services categories should remain Apple s growth engines  The FactSet consensus models 35  growth to  9 85 billion in revenue for the wearables and accessories category  which includes AirPods  Apple Watches  and the HomePod smart speaker  Analysts tracked by FactSet see services revenue climbing about 20  to  13 06 billion \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Stock movement  Apple shares have

to FactSet  8 4  lower than recent levels   What the analysts are saying Apple s wearables and accessories category was a star three months back  and analysts believe that holiday demand for smartwatches and AirPods was strong  D A  Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote that by Black Friday  Apple s AirPods Pro were already unavailable until after the holidays  and will be interested in any Apple commentary on whether existing AirPods owners traded up to the more expensive  noise cancelling model that was introduced at the end of the year  Forte rates Apple s stock a buy with a  375 target price    Don t miss  Apple may not get the big 5G bump investors expect  analyst says in downgrade  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives echoed the optimism around AirPods  writing that they re showing  jaw dropping  momentum  which could drive a positive earnings surprise Tuesday along with  robust  iPhone 11 demand in Asia  He has an outperform rating and  400 target on Apple s shares  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that he s torn on Apple s stock given its big run up but also its tendency to outperform when revenue estimates head higher  And while he s not expecting a ton of upside for the December quarter  he said forecasts for the rest of the year seem too low   principally for AirPods  where we estimate that we are above the Street by about  4 billion to  8 billion  providing a 150 300 bps cushion to total revenues per quarter   On Tuesday s call  he ll be watching for anything that iPhone challenges    Our relatively sanguine FY20 iPhone forecast is contingent on Apple achieving nearly double digit unit growth in the face of a potential  8  ASP headwind  which is not necessarily a slam dunk   wrote Sacconaghi  who has a market perform rating and  300 target on the shares    Read  The long promised  Year of 5G  arrives with more promises and little 5G  Bank of America s Wamsi Mohan asks  who doesn t  expect a strong December quarter from Apple  and while he thinks the stock could move higher following the report  he said opportunities for upside might be  more hazy  after that  Trends to watch for include commodity price inflation around DRAM and NAND storage  which could pressure margins  and the accounting impacts of the Apple TV  free trials  He rates the stock a buy with a  340 target  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

see a wave or risk aversion benefit gold prices  We get into the heart of the Q4 earnings season this week  with almost 400 companies on deck to release quarterly results  including 139 S P 500 members  We have had a good run this earnings season thus far  with decent momentum on the revenues side and an above average proportion of companies beating top line estimates While the number of companies beating EPS estimates is tracking below other recent quarters  the tone and substance of management guidance and commentary is by and large favorable and reassuring  which is helping sustain estimates for the current and coming quarters  In fact  estimates for full year 2020 have actually nudged up in the last few weeks The Finance sector is heavily represented in the reports thus far  with this week bringing in a fairly representative cross section of all the other sectors  The focus this coming week will be on the Technology sector  with bellwethers like Apple  AAPL   Microsoft  MSFT   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   FB   Amazon  AMZN  and others on deck to report results The sector experienced earnings declines in the first three quarters of 2019  Ahead of this earnings season  the expectation was for continuation of that trend in Q4 as well  While Q4 earnings for the sector are still expected to be below the year earlier level  the expected decline has roughly halved following the impressive Intel  INTC  showing A big part of Intel s outperformance came from the chip maker s datacenter business  which not only has favorable read throughs for the semiconductor space as a whole  but likely also Microsoft and Amazon that are leaders in the cloud computing space The semiconductor industry  which accounts for almost a sixth of the Tech sector s total earnings  has been in a cyclical funk in recent quarters that has been dragging down the entire sector  As you can see in the chart below of quarterly earnings growth for the chip industry  the year over year declines have started decelerating already  with a 2019 Q4 earnings decline of  16 5  representing an improvement over the preceding three quarters As you can see in the above chart  the industry isn t expected to get back into any significant growth phase in the next few quarters  But at least it will stop being a drag on the Tech sector a whole  which should help the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index  After all  the Tech sector is the biggest earnings contributor in the S P 500 index  expected to bring in roughly 24  of the index s total earnings over the coming four quarters  It will be interesting to see if the Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   AMD  earnings report on Tuesday will also reflect what we saw in the Intel report Total Tech sector earnings are expected to decline  2 8  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  This would follow the  7  decline in the sector s earnings in the preceding quarter on  2 4  higher revenues As you can see in the above chart  the sector s earnings growth picture is expected to notably improve in the current period  2020 Q1   with growth turning positive in Q1 and ramping up in the following quarters Q4 Scorecard  as of Friday  January 24th For the 85 S P 500 members that have reported Q4 results already  total earnings or aggregate net income is down  0 2  from the same period last year on  3 4  higher revenues  with 70 6  beating EPS estimates and 72 9  beating revenue estimates The comparison charts below put these results in the context of what this same group of 85 index members have been reporting in other recent periods  The first set of charts compare the beats percentages while the second set does a similar comparison for Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates Q4 EPS   Revenue Beats

estimates and 81 8  beating revenue estimates  \\nThe charts below put the sector s Q4 results in a historical context The aforementioned revenue momentum is very much visible in the Finance results  as you can see if you focus just on the orange bars in the above charts \\nQ4 Expectations for the S P 500 Index\\nLooking at Q4 expectations as a whole  combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings  or aggregate net income  for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  2 6  from the same period last year on  3 7  higher revenues  with 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have lower earnings than the year earlier period \\nThe table below shows the summary picture for Q4  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding earnings season The chart below shows Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following four quarters and actual results in the preceding 4 quarters  As you can see  the growth pace is expected to start improving from next quarter onwards The chart below shows the earnings picture on an annual basis  As you can see  growth is expected to resume in 2020 and continue the following year  after the modest decline in 2019 The way 2020 Q1 and full year 2020 expectations evolve in the coming weeks and months will depend to a large extent on

this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look  I got a great question recently from Barbara P  who wants to know \\n What do I do if a stock you ve recommended has already run up 100  \\nThat s a far more common situation than most people think \\nWhat s more  it s a terrific problem to have \\nLet me explain \\n\\nMillions of investors dream about finding the next Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  or Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   with good reason  Every  10 000 invested in the former when it went public is now worth a staggering  285 690  while every  10 000 invested in the latter when it first traded is now worth a jaw dropping  9 49 million \\nWhat they re really wondering when they ask this question  though  is something slightly different \\nI ve talked with tens of thousands of investors over the years  and what they re really asking most of the time is some variation of the following trifecta \\nIsn t XYZ too expensive Did I miss the boat Can I still profit Let s talk about that today \\nMyth  It s Too Expensive\\n\\nFirst  just because a stock like Amazon is trading at  1 870 a share doesn t mean it s expensive \\n\\nCase in point  Many folks thought Amazon was expensive at  286 a share in 2015  And again in 2016  when shares were trading at  498 \\nNow  that looks cheap \\nQuality stocks are always making new highs  and some pretty smart people will perpetually caution you that they can t go any higher   that s the way financial markets work \\nTake Dr  Nouriel  Dr  Doom  Roubini  for example \\nHe began calling for a massive market crash in 2005  and he got one three years later  which means  by implication  he missed the run up and all the profits that went with it \\nThe late author and economist Howard Ruff published a bestseller called  How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years   and published it in 1979  immediately before one of the biggest bull runs in recorded history \\nRuff surfaced again in 2009 with more alarmingly bearish commentary  exactly one month before the markets began what is now the single longest bull run in recorded history \\nThing is  great stocks are never expensive  because they can grow into earnings  at the click of a mouse  over long periods of time  by doing things the market thinks are impossible  when customers  must have  the products and services they make \\nNo doubt you see the magic here \\nMyth  You Missed the Boat\\nWe aren t fishing or water skiing  so no  you didn t miss the boat \\nIn fact  investing in the world s best companies after they ve  tested the waters  could benefit you in the long run \\n\\nTake Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  for example \\nI was one of the first analysts   and may have  in fact  been the first   to latch on to the company s medical pivot several years ago  I saw profit potential that the market had not yet recognized and counseled you to invest accordingly \\nThe stock has more than doubled since \\nMy point is not that I was right  I got lucky  this is a tough business  and I simply put two and two together \\nApple s insurmountable success is far deeper than just a pivot into medical devices or switching to a service based business approach \\nWhat s important to understand   something most investors fail to recognize   is that a  500 stock can double to become a  1 000 stock just as easily as a  5 stock  Perhaps  dare I say it  even easier  because those same companies have a rock solid groundwork to build upon and a consistent and steady revenue stream powered by scores of customers who cannot live without the products and services they produce \\nUnlike many of the Johnny come latelies  they re not digging themselves into debt just to get themselves off the ground  nor are they reliant on a public offering powered by smoke and mirrors \\nIn fact  value creation is a significant profit producer  a case I ve made in the latest Money Map Report via my 2020 Outlook \\nMyth  I Won t Be Able to Profit\\nYes  you can still profit \\nIn fact  you can always still profit  as long as you make the business case for that happening \\nThe math works at  10 a share  just like it works at  1 000 a share  A double is a double is a double \\nThis is where most investors go off the rails  They confuse percentages with profits and  in doing so  forget to ask  why  they re buying \\n\\nApple  for example  hasn t even begun to value half a dozen things it s working on  including cars  AI  and medical devices and information  including patient portals \\nI think the stock hits  400 a share very quickly now that it s smashed through the  300 price tag I slapped on it last January  That s another 50  higher than it s trading today  after a 120 1  run up from last January s low of  142 19 \\nYou get the idea \\n\\nCould Apple fall \\nSure  that s always a possibility  However  that s really a related question about risk management  not profit potential \\nThink about that for a second \\nThe world s best companies can add a million customers at the click of a button or merely by

at 10 00 am along with ISM Manufacturing By Sam Mattera Apparently when we got right down to the last 2 weeks of the year  the world had decided that some of their favorite stocks of 2012 were going to succumb to the fiscal cliff  I am not speaking of some high flying names like Apple  AAPL  or Amazon  AMZN   but rather the rocks of your portfolio  Campbell s Soup  CPB   HJ Heinz  HNZ  and General Mills  GIS   These stocks each lost 5  from December 18th through to the December 31st  Let me remind you that these companies make things  Things that people buy no matter what the economic environment  Soup  Cheerios  and Ketchup  Nobody gives these up  My dad eats a half a box of Cheerios everyday himself  And these are massive companies between 10 and 30 billion dollars  What are they doing getting a 5  haircut in 2 weeks  What is that you say  It s the dividend  Each has over a 3 3  dividend yield so they were a prime target for sale with the potential for a dividend tax hike  Hmmm  Did you miss the part where these companies are massive and sell things that people buy and consume everyday  Dividend tax rates were never going to 100   So the congressy people put a fence around the cliff so we do not fall off and what happens  Rally  But lucky for you  these three have not fully recovered their 5  drops  They are close but that pullback did wonders for the weekly charts  Heinz above and Campbell s Soup below  both bounced off of the 20 week Simple Moving Average  SMA   held their Relative Strength Indexes  RSI  in bullish territory and now look ready to resume their trends higher Maybe you should be looking at these pullbacks as an opportunity to enter these stellar stocks that you may have missed earlier  Disclaimer  The information in this blog post

 please see my  page for my full disclaimer  Congress got its act together just enough to stave off the fiscal cliff  Unfortunately  they merely added a long  pirate plank  to the edge of the cliff  as spending was not addressed  So the country has stepped off the cliff and now we are  walking the plank   albeit without the blindfold since we know when the debt ceiling and sequestration are scheduled to kick in Our elected representatives inked a deal that satisfies no one  despite the self congratulatory rhetoric you hear from the White House on fulfilling the  tax the rich  promise  Still left unresolved are the debt ceiling  sequestration  spiraling health care expenses and entitlement reform  With no agreed upon spending cuts of any kind  it appears that we will be adding substantially to the already out of control deficit   That government is best which governs least  is now just a quant old saying from our founding fathers in another place and time that has been cast into history s scrap heap by an entitlement hungry electorate Nevertheless  investors cheered the tax deal  such as it is  by providing an impressive upside gap on Wednesday morning followed by a strong late day finish  Coupled with Monday s strong engulfing candlestick  the S P 500 gained a robust 4 3  in just 2 trading days and each day ended with a surge in buying rather than profit taking  Not too shabby  The epitome of a relief rally  Even Apple  AAPL  seems to want to reestablish its former glory as a market leader Macro PictureMost of the big macro concerns of 2012 are still in place  however  The MacroReport  a co publication of Sabrient Systems and MacroRisk Analytics  addressed many of them during the past year  including the Eurozone debt crisis  China s growth rate  global oil prices  and central bank initiatives  But with low interest rates and lots of investable cash  stocks still have a strong wind in their sails at least until the debt ceiling is hit I mentioned in mid December that it might be worthwhile to buy some February call options on a market index as a lottery ticket for a bullish surge after a budget deal is inked  I hope you did so  I took my own advice and bought some calls on the SPY  I sold half on Wednesday just to get my original investment back  while letting the balance of the position ride risking only house money The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 146 04  Monday s big engulfing candle retraced the full span of the bull flag pattern after 140 provided strong support  and then Wednesday brought a massive gap breakout  blasting through resistance at 143 and 145  It now is trying to break through this area of triple top resistance  146 148   Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all pointing up bullishly  although we eventually should see at least a partial retracement of the breakaway gap  The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   fell nearly 20  on Wednesday to close at 14 68  which is down from its brief fear spike above 23 last Friday and well below the important 20 threshold  Its 35 4  fall over the past two trading days is the biggest 2 day drop in the history of the VIX  Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend  As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations These rankings reflect a pre budget deal conservatism  There has been very little in the way of Wall Street adjustments to earnings estimates  Healthcare has surged to the top with an Outlook score of 88  IYH shows relatively good support among analysts  a reasonably good forward P E  and solid return ratios  Consumer Goods  IYK  holds onto second place with an Outlook score of 81  It boasts the best analyst score and strong return ratios  Technology  IYW  has fallen to third place with a 71  and then there is a 19 point gap down to Energy  IYE  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 14  and is joined in the bottom two this week by Consumer Services  IYC  with a 30  Stocks within IYZ appear overvalued from the standpoint of the forward P E and lack analyst support Overall  I would characterize the fundamentals based Outlook rankings as slightly defensive  with Healthcare and Consumer Goods at the top of the rankings followed by the all weather Tech and Energy sectors  The more economically sensitive sectors like Industrial  Financial  Materials  and Consumer Services are all languishing a bit  which reflects uncertainty among Wall Street analysts about economic growth and the Federal budget negotiations  However  I suspect that next week s rankings might be a bit less defensive given recent developments Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  has been the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 59  Utilities  IDU  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 42  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged Looking at the Bear scores  none of the sectors are scoring very high  Utilities  IDU  is still the favorite safe haven on weak market days  but it s only scoring an amemic 50  which indicates that most everything is selling off during recent market weakness  Energy  IYE  is the worst during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 38  but there s only a 12 point range from top to bottom  Still  Energy stocks have been selling off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best Overall  Healthcare  IYH  now shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 180  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 111  However  looking at just the Bull Bear combination  IYH doesn t look very good at all with a total score of only 92 which is tied with Utilities  IDU  for the lowest  Somewhat surprisingly  Basic Materials  IYM  now has the best score at 101  while Energy  IYE  and Utilities  IDU  share the worst at 94  So  although IYH has the best Outlook score  investor sentiment as reflected by Bull and Bear behavior has not corroborated it These scores represent the view that the Healthcare and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Consumer Services sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our one to three month forward look  Top ranked stocks within IYH and IYK include DaVita HealthCare Partners  DVA   Gilead Sciences  GILD   Middleby Corp   MIDD  and Monsanto  MON   By the way  Sabrient is proud to announce that our  Baker s Dozen  Top Stocks for 2012 closed the year up an astounding  43   This was the fourth straight year of market beating returns since inception in 2009  A third party web site called Dark Liquidity has been tracking a number of model portfolios from the larger brokers  financial publications  and independents  and Sabrient finished well ahead of all of them as described in this Seeking Alpha   The new Sabrient Baker s Dozen list for 2013 will be released on January 11 in conjunction with a Unit Investment Trust for the same portfolio  You can learn more at   Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned  About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look  Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions  Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors  About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias  However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs \",\n          \"The Hoot \\nActionable ideas for the

thing too because on Wednesday the Dow stopped falling only because the bell rang at 4 PM after a 178 point red marubozu  That was good for a rising RTC bearish trigger and a bearish stochastic crossover  Aside from the outside possibility of a DCB  there s nothing technically bullish about this char t  The VIX  Last night I called for  an even better reversal case  than Tuesday  for Wednesday    Well case closed  The VIX popped right out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup with a 9 5  gain while the stochastic curved into position for a bullish crossover   Technically this

this indicator continues bearish   Dollar index  With a giant gap up Tuesday last night I noted the need to wait and see where the dollar would go next  Turns out it was lower as the big empty space

whims of the current Greek comedy and that s no doubt going to go right down to the wire  So I m going to call Thursday cautiously higher with the caveat that it will take just one news release from

finds that only 28   have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the banks   Even though that s up from the 21  lows in 2012 s poll  it s well below the 40  average the banking industry held for the past 35 years  And it s still well below the peak year of 1979 s 60  rating  The survey shows that 67  of Americans have confidence in small business  but just 21  have confidence in  big business   There are many reasons to dislike big banks  they made wild bets and drove the economy into the ground  scooped up massive bailouts  paid out big bonuses  foreclosed on more than 4 million homeowners  and rigged every market from Libor to forex to maybe even US Treasury bonds  And after all that the big banks are bigger than ever  which is part of the problem  they have little competition and therefore no incentive to improve conduct or service  For banks to regain public confidence  Gallup suggests some common sense  treat customers better  An interesting though unlikely
